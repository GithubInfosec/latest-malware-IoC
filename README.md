As a value-added service at InfoSEC, our SOC team has created a github repository where you can find the latest Indicators of Compromise and Attack (IOC/IOA) based on the discovery of malware variants from the latest threat researches. These include not only malicious file names, signatures and hashes (file-based IoC), but also IP and port-based indicators at the network level (network-based IoC), as well as application-level URLs, domain names, e-mail addresses, and services like botnet command and control servers (C2). You can think of it as a source of threat intelligence, which has become critical in recent years. This way, you'll have access to up-to-date malicious indicators compiled from as many sources as possible before cyber threats reach your business.

We have also created yara rules so that you can quickly integrate these malicious indicators into your security products. 
You can access them from *.yar files under the relevant folder.

You can also find summaries of reference reports where malicious findings were uncovered in the repo, as well as highlights and mitigation steps to protect against attack campaigns. We strive to share more with our customers and strengthen their security posture.
