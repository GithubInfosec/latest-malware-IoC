## Key Findings

- TAG-100 has likely compromised organizations in at least ten countries in Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Oceania and, following initial access, employed the open-source Go backdoors Pantegana and SparkRAT.
- TAG-100 has also conducted probable reconnaissance and exploitation activity targeting the internet-facing appliances of additional organizations in at least fifteen countries in North America, Europe, and Asia.
- Based on identified TAG-100 targeted and victim hosts, it is likely the group exploited various internet-facing products, including Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances, F5 BIG-IP, Zimbra Collaboration Suite, Microsoft Exchange, SonicWall, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA), Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, and Fortinet FortiGate.
- In the immediate aftermath of releasing a PoC exploit for Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, TAG-100 conducted probable reconnaissance and attempted exploitation against dozens of US-based organizations running these devices.
- The widespread targeting of internet-facing appliances is particularly attractive as it offers a foothold within targeted networks via products that often have limited visibility, logging capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions, reducing the risk of detection post-exploitation.

Since at least February 2024, Insikt Group has identified likely victim organizations in **Cambodia**, **Djibouti**, the **Dominican Republic**, **Fiji**, **Indonesia**, the **Netherlands**, **Taiwan**, the **United Kingdom**, the **United States**, and **Vietnam** communicating with TAG-100 command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. Victims included industry trade associations as well as government, intergovernmental, diplomatic, political, semiconductor supply-chain, non-profit, and religious organizations across these countries, including the following notable organizations:

- Intergovernmental organizations headquartered in Southeast Asia and Oceania
- Ministries of Foreign Affairs of countries in Southeast Asia, South America, and the Caribbean
- The Embassy of a Southwest Asian country in the United States
- Multiple religious organizations in the US and Taiwan
- A US-based financial industry trade association
- A Taiwanese semiconductor testing and assembly company

Most victim IP addresses host internet-facing appliances, including Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway, Zimbra Collaboration Suite, Microsoft Exchange, SonicWall, Cisco ASA, and Fortinet FortiGate products.

<p align="center"><em>Overview of TAG-100 operations (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>

TAG-100 has conducted reconnaissance and exploitation activities targeting a wide range of internet-facing appliances belonging to organizations in at least fifteen countries, including **Cuba**, **France**, **Italy**, **Japan**, and **Malaysia**. Notably, this included the targeting of multiple Cuban embassies, including in Bolivia, France, and the United States.

In March 2024, TAG-100 was identified targeting internet-facing Citrix NetScaler and F5 BIG-IP appliances and Outlook Web App login portals globally. In multiple instances, these targeted organizations directly overlapped with subsequent victims communicating with TAG-100 Pantegana C2 servers.

Beginning on April 16, 2024, TAG-100 conducted probable reconnaissance and exploitation activities targeting Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect appliances of organizations, mostly based in the US, within the education, finance, legal, local government, and utilities sectors. The timing of this activity aligned with the release of a PoC exploit for the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2024-3400.

In one instance, an open directory present on the staging server attributed to TAG-100, **209.141.57.75**, contained a publicly available exploit for the Zimbra Collaboration Suite vulnerability **CVE-2019-9621**.

### Employing Multiple Open-Source and Offensive Security Capabilities

In addition to employing publicly available exploits, TAG-100 has used multiple open-source or offensive security post-exploitation frameworks targeting multiple operating systems, including Pantegana, SparkRAT, LESLIELOADER, Cobalt Strike, and CrossC2.

---

#### Pantegana

Pantegana is an open-source malware family written in Go that features a cross-platform payload client (Windows, Linux, macOS) and uses HTTPS for C2 communications. It supports file upload and download, system fingerprinting, and direct command-line interaction with infected hosts. Pantegana also supports obfuscation using the open-source obfuscator Garble. Publicly reported use of Pantegana in the wild to date is minimal, other than a campaign exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Sophos Firewall appliance attributed by Volexity to the suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group DriftingCloud.

In March 2024, Insikt Group identified a cluster of TAG-100 C2 servers, all exhibiting the same self-signed transport layer security (TLS) certificate, which aligns with the default issuer and distinguished names seen in the Pantegana source code. On some TAG-100 Pantegana servers, the group also employed a customized TLS certificate, which used the organization name Google, Inc. rather than the default Pantegana value.

All identified TAG-100 servers were running identical services and were administered via the same nodes associated with the commercial VPN service ExpressVPN. Several victim organizations have been observed communicating with multiple TAG-100 Pantegana C2 servers over time, likely because the threat actor transitioned between an older C2 server and a newer one.

---

#### SparkRAT and LESLIELOADER

Multiple TAG-100 servers were concurrently linked to malware samples of another open-source Go backdoor, SparkRAT. TAG-100 also used a variant of the publicly available Go loader LESLIELOADER to load SparkRAT in several instances, including a chain previously documented in March 2024 Kroll research. On one occasion, we also observed a SparkRAT memory dump uploaded to a public malware repository that almost certainly originated from a Djibouti government network compromised by TAG-100.

TAG-100 SparkRAT servers observed by Insikt Group during Q1 2024 have directly overlapped with identified Pantegana C2 servers, including 104.200.67[.]156, 104.168.165[.]123, and 209.141.57[.]75. These SparkRAT servers were used to target victims in **Cambodia**, **Taiwan**, and **Vietnam**.

#### Cobalt Strike

TAG-100 has used both traditional Windows Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads using the Jquery malleable C2 profile as well as the open-source, cross-platform CrossC2 to generate Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads for Linux systems.

## Considering TAG-100 Attribution

While Insikt Group cannot attribute TAG-100 activity based on current evidence, the group’s consistent targeting of intergovernmental, diplomatic, and religious organizations aligns with a suspected espionage motive. Additionally, several targets of this activity align with historical targeting from Chinese state-sponsored groups, including Asia-Pacific intergovernmental and diplomatic entities, religious organizations in the United States and Taiwan, and a political party that has supported an investigation into the treatment of the Uyghur people by the Chinese government. Despite this, TAG-100’s use of open-source tooling coupled with the group’s pattern of life, targeting, and broader tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) provide some conflicting evidence, leading us to continue investigating potential attribution for this activity.

---

## Conclusion

TAG-100 has demonstrated the ability to employ open-source remote access capabilities and exploit internet-facing appliances for initial access, targeting high-profile organizations globally. The group's activity highlights the ongoing threat posed by the exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing devices and the use of open-source tools by state-sponsored actors. Effective mitigation strategies include intelligence-led patching prioritization, regular audits of internet-facing devices, and improving defense-in-depth measures to detect post-exploitation activities.
