## Introduction

- **Report Reference:** [APT41R01] 
- **Summarized by:** [InfoSec]  
- **Analysis Date:** [2024/7/18]  
- **Report Date:** [2024/7/18]

The full report will be available [here](https://github.com/GithubInfosec/test/blob/38a43cb41496619e169b3685431a1c596e1924b9/APT41/APT41%20Has%20Arisen%20From%20the%20DUST.pdf).

This report highlights APT41's ongoing campaign, identified by Mandiant and Google's TAG, targeting sectors in **Italy**, **Spain**, **Taiwan**, **Thailand**, **Turkey**, and the **United Kingdom** using tools like ANTSWORD, BLUEBEAM, and BEACON to exfiltrate sensitive data since 2023.

- In collaboration with Googleâ€™s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Mandiant has observed a sustained campaign by the advanced persistent threat group APT41 targeting and successfully compromising multiple organizations operating within the global shipping and logistics, media and entertainment, technology, and automotive sectors.
- The majority of organizations were operating in **Italy**, **Spain**, **Taiwan**, **Thailand**, **Turkey**, and the **United Kingdom**.
- APT41 successfully infiltrated and maintained prolonged, unauthorized access to numerous victims' networks since 2023, enabling them to extract sensitive data over an extended period.
- APT41 used a combination of ANTSWORD and BLUEBEAM web shells for the execution of DUSTPAN to execute BEACON backdoor for command-and-control communication.
- Later in the intrusion, APT41 leveraged DUSTTRAP, which would lead to hands-on keyboard activity.
- APT41 used publicly available tools SQLULDR2 for copying data from databases and PINEGROVE to exfiltrate data to Microsoft OneDrive.

## Overview

- Recently, Mandiant became aware of an APT41 intrusion where the malicious actor deployed a combination of ANTSWORD and BLUEBEAM web shells for persistence.
- These web shells were identified on a Tomcat Apache Manager server and active since at least 2023.
- APT41 utilized these web shells to execute certutil.exe to download the DUSTPAN dropper to stealthily load BEACON.
- As the APT41 intrusion progressed, the group escalated its tactics by deploying the DUSTTRAP dropper.
- Upon execution, DUSTTRAP would decrypt a malicious payload and execute it in memory, leaving minimal forensic traces.
- The decrypted payload was designed to establish communication channels with either APT41-controlled infrastructure for command and control or, in some instances, with a compromised Google Workspace account, further blending its malicious activities with legitimate traffic.
- The affected Google Workspace accounts have been successfully remediated to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Furthermore, APT41 leveraged SQLULDR2 to export data from Oracle Databases.
- APT41 used PINEGROVE to systematically and efficiently exfiltrate large volumes of sensitive data from the compromised networks, transferring to OneDrive to enable exfiltration and subsequent analysis.

## Victimology

- In collaboration with Google's TAG, Mandiant notified multiple additional organizations across various sectors that have been compromised by this campaign. The organizations impacted by this campaign originated from a diverse range of countries spanning multiple continents, including:
  - **Italy**
  - **Spain**
  - **Taiwan**
  - **Thailand**
  - **Turkey**
  - **United Kingdom**

- An analysis of victim organizations within specific sectors reveals a notable geographic distribution.
  - Nearly all targeted organizations operating in the shipping and logistics sector were located in **Europe** and the **Middle East**, with a single exception.
  - In contrast, all affected organizations within the media and entertainment sector were located in **Asia**.

- A significant portion of the victimized organizations within the shipping and logistics sector maintained operations across multiple continents, often as subsidiaries or affiliates of larger multinational corporations operating within the same industry.

- Mandiant has detected reconnaissance activity directed towards similar organizations operating within other countries such as **Singapore**.
- At the time of the publication, neither Mandiant nor Google TAG have any indicators of these organizations being compromised by APT41, but it could potentially indicate an expanded scope of targeting.
