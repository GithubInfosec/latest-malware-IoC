## Introduction

The Capybara DNS tunneling campaign, first identified in June 2024, leverages various methods of encoding and obfuscating data within DNS tunnels. This campaign uses customized encoding techniques, such as Base32, to mask its activity.

The campaign was named Capybara due to the presence of the string 'capybara' in several of the domain names, such as chkhj-capybara[.]biz. We have observed a large volume of fully qualified domain name (FQDN) detections, with a peak of 22,685,570 detections on a single day in August 2024.

### Domain Naming and Characteristics

- The root domains contain the string 'capybara' (e.g., chkhj-capybara[.]biz).
- Domains may impersonate legitimate brands, such as www-microsoft-ddfcs[.]com.
- **A record**: 104.236.196[.]131
- **NS record**: 167.71.250[.]194

### DNS Tunneling Technique

The Capybara campaign utilizes DNS tunneling, with data obfuscation methods including customized Base32 encoding. DNS tunneling can begin as early as the second day after a Capybara domain is registered.

### Capybara Campaign Timeline

- **Start Date**: June 2024
- **Peak Detection**: August 2024 (22,685,570 FQDN detections in one day)

### Observations and Metrics

- The campaign shows a consistent use of DNS tunneling for communication.
- It remains unclear what the purpose of this campaign is, as its intentions and targets are still being analyzed.
