- In late May 2024, Cleafy's Threat Intelligence team observed a surge in installations of a previously unknown app called "4K Sports", whose characteristics didn't perfectly align with known malware families.
- Initial investigations suggested a possible connection between the behaviour of the "4K Sports" app and the Medusa family.
- A more in-depth analysis revealed discrepancies between the app and previously documented variants, indicating an evolution in the Medusa malware with significant changes in its command structure and overall capabilities.
- The evolution of Medusa samples over the past few months suggests that TAs aim to enhance the efficiency of features while strengthening the botnet by refactoring permissions required during installation.
- The MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) model used by Medusa may be influencing this optimization phase, with new affiliates potentially driving the development of less detectable variants.

</p>

- **In May 2024**: Cleafy Threat Intelligence team tracked new fraud campaigns involving the Medusa (TangleBot) banking trojan, which had been under the radar for almost a year.
- **Medusa**: A sophisticated malware family with RAT capabilities discovered in 2020, featuring a keylogger, screen controls, and SMS read/write capabilities. These features enable On-Device Fraud (ODF) scenarios.
- **New Discrepancies**: Recent Medusa samples show discrepancies from previous versions, including a lighter permission set and new features such as a full-screen overlay and remote application uninstallation.
- **Botnets**: Identified five different botnets operated by several affiliates with distinct geographical targeting and decoy characteristics. Known targets include Turkey and Spain, with new targets such as France and Italy.
- **Distribution Shift**: TAs have started experimenting with “droppers” for malware distribution via fake update procedures.

## Conclusion

- **Strategic Shift**: The latest Medusa variant shows a move towards a lightweight approach with minimized permissions to evade detection, allowing for prolonged undetected operation.
- **Geographical Expansion**: The malware is expanding into new regions like Italy and France, indicating a deliberate effort to broaden its victim pool.
- **Distribution Evolution**: The adoption of droppers as a distribution method reflects a significant evolution in Medusa's threat capabilities. Although droppers have not yet been observed on the Google Play Store, future deployments via this channel are possible.
- **Comparison**: This distribution strategy is similar to other banking malware families like TeaBot and SharkBot, leveraging the trust associated with official app stores for broader distribution and higher infection rates.
- **Implications**: The combination of reduced permissions, geographical diversification, and sophisticated distribution methods highlights Medusa's evolving nature. Cyber-security experts and anti-fraud analysts must stay vigilant and adapt defenses to counter these emerging threats.
